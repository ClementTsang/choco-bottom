# choco-bottom

Repository to house choco files for [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom). See [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/bottom) for the chocolatey package.

Generally, unless something goes wrong, updates to this repo are done through an automated hook when a stable version of bottom releases. This creates a PR with the necessary changes, with a quick check to see if an install and version check work.

To test and deploy, see [here](https://chocolatey.org/courses/creating-chocolatey-packages/building-testing-and-pushing) for more info. For your conveneince, though, the gist is that in an admin/elevated terminal, run the following to test building the package and installing:

```bash
choco pack
choco uninstall bottom          # Just to avoid having to force
choco install bottom -dv -s .
```

Then open a new terminal (does not need to be admin) to reload PATH and test that things work:

```bash
btm --version                   # Just in case, check again - it should match the new version
btm                             # Test changes and general usage quickly
```

If this is all successful, you can deploy:

```bash
choco push <PACKAGE_NAME>.nupkg -s https://push.chocolatey.org/
```

Note this requires linking your account API key to your machine. You can easily do so by logging in to Chocolatey and going to your API keys section, and following the instructions there.

After that, wait for the automated checks and you're done!
